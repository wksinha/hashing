# String Search
When given large strings and checking for presence, it can be efficient to store their hashes instead.  
Here, we check our implementation using polynomial hashing against an ideal solution with perfect memory.

## Usage
For random tests, run:  
```
bash test.sh
```

For large tests, run:  
```
bash test_large.sh
```
